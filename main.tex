\begin{frame}[mpidrbackground=2]
    \frametitle{How it works}
  Every slide has a background which is a pdf-export of the official MPIDR-Powerpoint template.\\
  
  You can choose the background by specifying  mpidrbackground={1...5}
  
  where {1...5} is a number between 1 and 5 (duuh!)

\begin{frame}[mpidrbackground=1, fragile,label=notleM2bis] %these options are only necessary for "verbatim" (showing latex code).
    \frametitle{Different Text Colors}
        %\setbeamercolor{item}{fg=green}
    \setbeamercolor{normal text}{fg=white}
    \usebeamercolor[fg]{normal text}
    
    If you use the slide with the green background, you have to change the text color to white.
    \begin{verbatim}
        \setbeamercolor{normal text}{fg=white}
        \usebeamercolor[fg]{normal text}
    \end{verbatim}

    \frametitle{Style Files}
  Any style file that you need for this document can be found in the subfolder \texttt{./mpidrtheme}.\\
  
  The style file is included by the line
	\begin{verbatim}
		\usepackage[mpidr]{./mpidr/mpidr21}
	\end{verbatim}
	in the preamble.
	
	You can edit and delete the footer (footline) in the mpidrtheme/mpidr21.sty-file.

  \frametitle{There Is No Largest Prime Number}
  \begin{theorem}
		There is no largest prime number.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item<1-| alert@1> Suppose $p$ were the largest prime number.
    \item<2-> Let $q$ be the product of the first $p$ numbers.
    \item<3-> Then $q+1$ is not divisible by any of them.
    \item<1-> Thus $q+1$ is also prime and greater than $p$.\qedhere

    \frametitle{Formulae}
	Of course, there is no limit in typesetting mathematical formulae:
	\begin{align}
		V_{ab}^s\left(q, i z_\mu\right)
			&= \frac{V_{ab}(q)}{1-\sum_{c}V_{cc}(q)\Pi_{cc}\left(q, i z_\mu\right)} 
				\equiv \frac{V_{ab}(q)}{\varepsilon\left(q, i z_\mu\right)}  \\
		\rule{0pt}{2em}\varepsilon\left(q, iz_\mu\right) 
			&= 1-\sum_c V_{cc}(q)\Pi_{cc}\left(q, i z_\mu\right)
	\end{align}
	As you can see above, there is no need for using boxes.
